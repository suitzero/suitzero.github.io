            <p>
                With over 15 years of experience in software development, primarily in game development and publishing, I bring a versatile skill set applicable to diverse challenges. My recent work at Twitter involved platform engineering, contributing to large-scale service infrastructure. I am passionate about continuous learning, particularly in mathematics and physics, and enjoy applying this knowledge to create innovative solutions.

			Following introduction is generated by chatGPT<br>
			As a seasoned programmer with around 15 years of professional experience, I have a wealth of knowledge and skills in the field of software development. In fact, I began writing code long before I even learned trigonometry!<br>


			Throughout my career, I have worked primarily in game development and publishing, where I have served as a generalist, working on a wide range of different problems and projects. More recently, I had the opportunity to work at Twitter as a software engineer, where I was responsible for working on a project that helped to provide the platform as a service.<br>


			As a programmer, I have often felt that we live in the shadow of physicists and mathematicians. For this reason, I enjoy spending my free time learning math and physics, imagining that I may one day be able to make a significant contribution that encompassing all of these fields.<br>


			In addition to my interest in programming and mathematics, I also have a passion for martial arts, meditation, and surfing. I believe that these activities help me to stay grounded and focused in my work, and I always strive to maintain a healthy balance between my professional and personal pursuits.<br>
